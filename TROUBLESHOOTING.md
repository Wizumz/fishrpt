# 🔧 GitHub Pages Deployment Troubleshooting

## Current Issue: Git Process Exit Code 128

### ✅ Fixes Applied

1. **Updated GitHub Actions Workflow Permissions**
   - Changed from `contents: read` to `contents: write`
   - Added `fetch-depth: 0` for full git history
   - Updated to `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4`
   - Added explicit git user configuration

### 📋 Repository Settings to Check

#### 1. **GitHub Pages Source Configuration**
Go to: `Repository Settings → Pages`

**Option A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)**
- Source: `Deploy from a branch`
- Branch: `gh-pages` / `(root)`

**Option B: Actions (Alternative)**
- Source: `GitHub Actions`

#### 2. **Actions Permissions**
Go to: `Repository Settings → Actions → General`

**Required Settings:**
- ✅ Actions permissions: `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`
- ✅ Workflow permissions: `Read and write permissions`
- ✅ Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests: `Enabled`

#### 3. **Branch Protection Rules**
Go to: `Repository Settings → Branches`

**Check for:**
- ❌ No protection rules on `gh-pages` branch (if it exists)
- ✅ Main branch can have protection rules

### 🚀 Manual Deployment Test

If the automatic deployment still fails, try the alternative workflow:

1. Go to `Actions` tab in your repository
2. Select `Deploy to GitHub Pages (Alternative)`
3. Click `Run workflow` button
4. Choose `main` branch and click `Run workflow`

### 🔍 Common Issues & Solutions

#### Issue: "remote: Permission to user/repo.git denied"
**Solution:** Check Actions permissions (step 2 above)

#### Issue: "Branch protection rule violations"
**Solution:** Disable protection rules for `gh-pages` branch

#### Issue: "Repository not found"
**Solution:** Ensure the repository is public or GitHub Pages is enabled for private repos

#### Issue: "No deploy key or GitHub token"
**Solution:** Verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` has write permissions

### 📊 Verification Steps

After successful deployment:

1. **Check Actions Tab**
   - Green checkmark on latest workflow run
   - No red X or failed steps

2. **Check Pages Settings**
   - Shows "Your site is live at https://username.github.io/repository-name/"
   - Last deployment timestamp is recent

3. **Test the Site**
   - Visit the GitHub Pages URL
   - Verify the fishing report app loads
   - Test a fishing report generation

### 🆘 If Still Failing

1. **Check the Actions logs for specific error messages**
2. **Try the manual workflow deployment**
3. **Verify all repository settings match the requirements above**
4. **Consider using Vercel or Netlify as alternatives**

### 📝 Expected Behavior

✅ **Successful Deployment Flow:**
1. Push to main branch triggers workflow
2. Build completes successfully 
3. Static files generated in `.output/public/`
4. Files pushed to `gh-pages` branch
5. GitHub Pages serves from `gh-pages` branch
6. Site accessible at GitHub Pages URL
