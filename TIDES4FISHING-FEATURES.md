## ⏲️ **Barometric Pressure Gauge**

### **Professional Pressure Display (Tides4Fishing Style)**
- **🎯 Semicircle Gauge**: 29.0 - 31.0 inHg range
- **🎨 Color-Coded Zones**: 
  - Red zone (29.0-30.0): Lower pressure conditions
  - Green zone (30.0-31.0): Higher pressure conditions
- **📍 Animated Needle**: Real-time pressure indication
- **🎣 Fishing Condition Assessment**:
  - **VERY GOOD**: High pressure (>30.2) or rapidly changing pressure
  - **GOOD**: Moderate pressure (29.8-30.2) or moderate pressure changes
  - **POOR**: Low pressure (<29.8) with stable conditions

### **Pressure Trend Analysis**:
- **Rising Rapidly** / **Rising Slowly**: Often indicates improving fishing
- **Falling Rapidly** / **Falling Slowly**: Can trigger feeding activity
- **Steady**: Less optimal for fishing activity

**Why This Matters**: Rapidly changing barometric pressure often triggers fish feeding activity, making it an excellent predictor for fishing success.

## 🌊 **Tides & Solunar Overlay Chart**

### **Multi-Layer Visualization (Tides4Fishing's Best Feature)**
This chart combines multiple data layers in a single, comprehensive view:

#### **🌊 Base Layer: Tide Progression**
- **Cyan tide curve** showing 24-hour tide height progression
- **Smooth interpolation** between high and low tides
- **Real-time tide height** values

#### **🟢 Major Solunar Periods (Green Overlay)**
- **2.5-hour windows** of peak fishing activity
- **06:30-08:30** (Morning Major)
- **18:45-20:45** (Evening Major)
- **Semi-transparent green background** highlighting optimal fishing times

#### **🟡 Minor Solunar Periods (Yellow Overlay)**
- **1.25-hour windows** of moderate fishing activity  
- **00:15-01:15** (Midnight Minor)
- **12:30-13:30** (Midday Minor)
- **Semi-transparent yellow background** for secondary fishing periods

#### **🌅 Sunrise/Sunset Markers (Orange)**
- **Triangle markers** at sunrise (🌅) and sunset (🌇) times
- **Vertical orange lines** showing light transition periods
- **Critical timing** for many fish species' feeding patterns

### **Visual Legend**:
```
🔵 ████ Tide Height (Primary curve)
🟢 ▓▓▓▓ Major Solunar (Best fishing - 2hr windows)
🟡 ▓▓▓▓ Minor Solunar (Good fishing - 1hr windows)  
🔶 ▲ ▲  Sunrise/Sunset (Light transitions)
```

## 📊 **Tidal Coefficient Chart**

### **Tide Strength Analysis (7-Day Forecast)**
- **📈 Line Chart**: Shows tidal coefficient progression over 7 days
- **Coefficient Scale**: 0-120 (higher = stronger tides)
- **Color-Coded Current Status**:
  - **🟢 Spring Tide** (95+): Strongest tides, best fishing
  - **🟢 Strong** (80-95): Very good tidal movement
  - **🔵 Moderate** (60-80): Average tidal conditions
  - **🟡 Weak** (40-60): Limited tidal movement
  - **🔴 Neap Tide** (20-40): Weakest tides

### **Key Metrics Display**:
- **Today's Coefficient**: Current tidal strength
- **Tide Strength Level**: Classification (Spring/Strong/Moderate/Weak/Neap)
- **Next Spring Tide**: Prediction for upcoming strong tides

**Why Tidal Coefficient Matters**: Higher coefficients mean stronger tidal currents, which often correlate with better fishing as they bring more food and oxygen to fish.
